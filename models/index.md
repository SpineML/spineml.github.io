Models
-----

All SpineML models are contained within the main [SpineML repository](https://github.com/SpineML/spineml) alongside the schemas.

The examples below are all from the repository and are classified as either SpineCreator examples or Toolchain examples. SpineCreator examples have a project file, toolchain examples do not and are pure SpineML. Toolchain examples can however be imported into SpineCreator and are examples pass validation against the schema. To test validation you can use a tool such as [xmllint](http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html).

# SpineCreator Example Models

## Gurney, Prescott and Redgrave Basal Ganglia model

This is a rate coded model of the Basal Ganglia. Details can be found in the following paper

A computational model of action selection in the basal ganglia. II. Analysis and simulation of behaviour K. Gurney, T. J. Prescott, P. Redgrave

## Gurney, Prescott and Redgrave Basal Ganglia model, spiking implementation

This is an integrate and fire neuron spiking version of the rate coded model of the Basal Ganglia found above.

## Angular Velocity Detector Unit model

This is a model of the angular velocity detection system in the insect from the following paper.

Cope A., Sabo C., Gurney K., Vasilaki E., and Marshall J. A. R. (2016), “A Model for an Angular Velocity-Tuned Motion Detector Accounting for Deviations in the Corridor-Centering Response of the Bee,” PLoS Computational Biology. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004887.s001

A SpineCreator viewable model is available below.

If you wish to execute the model and reporoduce the results from the paper then you should also download the complete repository and follow the detailed instructions.

# SpineML toolchain examples

These example consist of pure SpineML with no SpineCreator project files or metadata. They can be imported into SpineCreator, but do not have 2D or 3D layout data.

## Brette Benchmark Model

### Network

A network of two populations of Excitatory and Inhibitory neurons. Based upon the model described in; [Romain Brette et al. "Simulation of networks of spiking neurons: A review of tools and strategies", 2007.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17629781)

## Brette Benchmark Model (Using PyNN Neurons)

This is the same as above however the synapse model is integrated into the neuron body. The Post-Synapse component acts as a pass-through.

### Components

### Network

A network of two populations of Excitatory and Inhibitory neurons. Based upon the model described in; [Romain Brette et al. "Simulation of networks of spiking neurons: A review of tools and strategies", 2007.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17629781). Replicates the standard Brett Benchmark model however the PyNN_PostSynpases redirects any impulse events to the post synaptic neuron body which models the dynamics. PyNN uses separate synaptic currents for excitatory and inhibitory synapses and as such negative synaptic weights are not required.
