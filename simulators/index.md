A simulation tool-chain for the SpineML format is available using XSLT code generation for three simulators; [Brahms], [DAMSON] and [PyNN]. Each simulator requires a complete set of (schema validated) component, network and experiment descriptions of a model. A set of simulator specific templates is then applied to the model to automatically generate simulation code compatible with simulator. Logging and outputs will generated in the native simulator format.
