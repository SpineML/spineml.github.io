[GeNN](https://genn-team.github.io/genn/) is a GPU enhanced Neuronal
Network simulation environment based on NVIDIA CUDA technology.

Work is currently in progress on SpineML_2_GeNN, which generates GeNN
code from a SpineML model. The code is found within the SpineML_to_GeNN
directory in the genn github repository:
[https://github.com/genn-team/genn](https://github.com/genn-team/genn)

Be warned that there is currently no documentation whatever, and the
current state of the SpineML_to_GeNN code relates to an old version of
the GeNN code. Nevertheless, a comparison of SpineML_2_BRAHMS and
SpineML_2_GeNN will give insight into the common features required by
a SpineML simulator back-end.
