# Spiking Neural Mark-up Language

The Spiking Neural Mark-up Language (SpineML) is a declarative XML based model description language for large scale neural network models. It is partially based upon on the INCF NineML syntax utilising the LEMS (Low Entropy Model Specification) common model specification syntax which is proposed to unite a range of INCF supported simulators including NeuroML v2.0 and PyNN.
The syntax is designed primarily for the specification of large scale networks of point neurons but also has the flexibility to describe biologically constrained models consisting of non standard components (such as gap junctions).

## Features

* Portable format
* Biological complexity
* Graphical modelling tools (with integrated simulator interface)
