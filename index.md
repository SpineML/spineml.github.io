# Spiking Neural Mark-up Language

The Spiking Neural Mark-up Language (SpineML) is a declarative XML
based model description language for large scale neural network
models. It is partially based upon on the INCF NineML syntax utilising
the LEMS (Low Entropy Model Specification) common model specification
syntax which is proposed to unite a range of INCF supported simulators
including NeuroML v2.0 and PyNN.

The syntax is designed primarily for the specification of large scale
networks of point neurons but also has the flexibility to describe
biologically constrained models consisting of non standard components
(such as gap junctions).

## Features

* Portable format
* Biological complexity
* Graphical modelling tools (with integrated simulator interface)

# SpineML Simulators

A model described in a declarative format needs a simulator to run
it. This site provides information about the simulators which have
been used to execute SpineML models, including the reference SpineML
simulator, [SpineML_2_BRAHMS](/simulators/BRAHMS).

# SpineCreator

Manually creating XML in a text editor is one way to create your
SpineML model, but we think you'll prefer
[SpineCreator](/spinecreator/); a graphical editor for SpineML.
