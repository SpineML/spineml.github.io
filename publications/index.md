To reference the SpineML language or code generation tool-chain please use the following publication. A further publication detailed the graphical tools is currently in development...

**Richmond P, Cope A, Gurney K, Allerton DJ.** “From Model Specification to Simulation of Biologically Constrained Networks of Spiking Neurons” *Neuroinformatics. 2013 Nov 20*

The following poster is available describing an overview of the toolchain.

**Cope AJ, Richmond P.** “A toolchain for creation of spiking neural networks utilising NineML - a tool independent XML model description format” *Poster presentation at eFutures workshop \`Building Bridges to Building Brains\` Edinburgh 2012* [available here](/public/images/e-futures_building_bridges_to_building_brains.pdf)
  
The following publications use SpineML and SpineCreator:

**Cope, A., Sabo, C., Gurney, K. N., Vasislaki, E., & Marshall, J. A. R.** “A Model for an Angular Velocity-Tuned Motion Detector Accounting for Deviations in the Corridor-Centering Response of the Bee” *PLoS Comput Biol. 2016*
