  description: "A model of motion detection in the bee created using SpineCreator"
  abstract: "We present a novel neurally based model for estimating angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain, capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including previously unaccounted for manipulations of behaviour. The model is fitted using electrophysiological data, and tested using behavioural data. Based on our model we suggest that the AV response can be considered as an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response. The detector is tested behaviourally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate down a corridor with gratings (square wave or sinusoidal) on the walls. When combined with an existing flight control algorithm the detector reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behaviour as found in the real bee’s behaviour. In addition, the summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer."

- title: "Striatal Neuropeptides Enhance Selection and Rejection of Sequential Actions"
  author-list: "D Buxton, E Bracci, P Overton, K Gurney"
  publication: "Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2017"
  description: "Describes a hybrid spiking/rate coded model of the
  striatal microcircuit"
  abstract: "The striatum is the primary input nucleus for the basal
  ganglia, and receives glutamatergic afferents from the cortex. Under
  the hypothesis that basal ganglia perform action selection, these
  cortical afferents encode potential “action requests.” Previous
  studies have suggested the striatum may utilize a mutually
  inhibitory network of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) to filter these
  requests so that only those of high salience are selected. However,
  the mechanisms enabling the striatum to perform clean, rapid
  switching between distinct actions that form part of a learned
  action sequence are still poorly understood. Substance P (SP) and
  enkephalin are neuropeptides co-released with GABA in MSNs
  preferentially expressing D1 or D2 dopamine receptors
  respectively. SP has a facilitatory effect on subsequent
  glutamatergic inputs to target MSNs, while enkephalin has an
  inhibitory effect. Blocking the action of SP in the striatum is also
  known to affect behavioral transitions. We constructed
  phenomenological models of the effects of SP and enkephalin, and
  integrated these into a hybrid model of basal ganglia comprising a
  spiking striatal microcircuit and rate–coded populations
  representing other major structures. We demonstrated that diffuse
  neuropeptide connectivity enhanced the selection of unordered action
  requests, and that for true action sequences, where action semantics
  define a fixed structure, a patterning of the SP connectivity
  reflecting this ordering enhanced selection of actions presented in
  the correct sequential order and suppressed incorrect ordering. We
  also showed that selective pruning of SP connections allowed
  context–sensitive inhibition of specific undesirable requests that
  otherwise interfered with selection of an action group. Our model
  suggests that the interaction of SP and enkephalin enhances the
  contrast between selection and rejection of action requests, and
  that patterned SP connectivity in the striatum allows the “chunking”
  of actions and improves selection of sequences. Efficient execution
  of action sequences may therefore result from a combination of
  ordered cortical inputs and patterned neuropeptide connectivity
  within striatum."

  publication: "IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental
  Systems, 2018"
  description: "Compares implementations of the same basal ganglia model in
  SpiNNaker and SpineCreator."
  abstract: "We present a biologically-inspired and scalable model of
  the Basal Ganglia (BG) simulated on the SpiNNaker machine, a
  biologically-inspired low-power hardware platform allowing parallel,
  asynchronous computing. Our BG model consists of six cell
  populations, where the neuro-computational unit is a
  conductance-based Izhikevich spiking neuron; the number of neurons
  in each population is proportional to that reported in anatomical
  literature. This model is treated as a single-channel of
  action-selection in the BG, and is scaled-up to three channels with
  lateral cross-channel connections. When tested with two competing
  inputs, this three-channel model demonstrates action-selection
  behaviour. The SpiNNaker-based model is mapped exactly on to SpineML
  running on a conventional computer; both model responses show
  functional and qualitative similarity, thus validating the usability
  of SpiNNaker for simulating biologically-plausible
  networks. Furthermore, the SpiNNaker-based model simulates in real
  time for time-steps > 1 ms; power dissipated during model execution
  is approx 1.8 W."

  author-list: "S James, C Papapavlou, A Blenkinsop, A Cope, S
  Anderson, K Moustakas, K Gurney"
  publication: "Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2018"
  description: "This paper presents a biophysically accurate
  oculomotor brain model which moves a virtual, biomechanical eye."
  abstract: "To date, realistic models of how the central nervous
  system governs behaviour have been restricted in scope to the brain,
  brainstem or spinal column, as if these existed as disembodied
  organs. Further, the model is often exercised in relation to an in
  vivo physiological experiment with input comprising an impulse, a
  periodic signal or constant activation, and output as a pattern of
  neural activity in one or more neural populations. Any link to
  behaviour is inferred only indirectly via these activity
  patterns. We argue that to discover the principles of operation of
  neural systems, it is necessary to express their behaviour in terms
  of physical movements of a realistic motor system, and to supply
  inputs that mimic sensory experience. To do this with confidence, we
  must connect our brain models to neuro-muscular models and provide
  relevant visual and proprioceptive feedback signals, thereby closing
  the loop of the simulation. This paper describes an effort to
  develop just such an integrated brain and biomechanical system using
  a number of pre-existing models. It describes a model of the
  saccadic oculomotor system incorporating a neuromuscular model of
  the eye and its six extraocular muscles. The position of the eye
  determines how illumination of a retinotopic input population
  projects information about the location of a saccade target into the
  system. A pre-existing saccadic burst generator model was
  incorporated into the system, which generated motoneuron activity
  patterns suitable for driving the biomechanical eye. The model was
  demonstrated to make accurate saccades to a target luminance under a
  set of environmental constraints. Challenges encountered in the
  development of this model showed the importance of this integrated
  modelling approach. Thus, we exposed shortcomings in individual
  model components which were only apparent when these were supplied
  with the more plausible inputs available in a closed loop
  design. Consequently we were able to suggest missing functionality
  which the system would require to reproduce more realistic
  behaviour. The construction of such closed-loop animal models
  constitutes a new paradigm of computational neurobehaviour and
  promises a more thoroughgoing approach to our understanding of the
  brain's function as a controller for movement and behaviour."
