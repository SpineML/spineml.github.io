  abstract: "We present a novel neurally based model for estimating angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain, capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including previously unaccounted for manipulations of behaviour. The model is fitted using electrophysiological data, and tested using behavioural data. Based on our model we suggest that the AV response can be considered as an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response. The detector is tested behaviourally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate down a corridor with gratings (square wave or sinusoidal) on the walls. When combined with an existing flight control algorithm the detector reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behaviour as found in the real beeâ€™s behaviour. In addition, the summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer."

  description: "A biophysically accurate oculomotor model which moves
  a biomechanical eye"
  abstract: "To date, realistic models of how the central nervous
  system governs behaviour have been restricted in scope to the brain,
  brainstem or spinal column, as if these existed as disembodied
  organs. Further, the model is often exercised in relation to an in
  vivo physiological experiment with input comprising an impulse, a
  periodic signal or constant activation, and output as a pattern of
  neural activity in one or more neural populations. Any link to
  behaviour is inferred only indirectly via these activity
  patterns. We argue that to discover the principles of operation of
  neural systems, it is necessary to express their behaviour in terms
  of physical movements of a realistic motor system, and to supply
  inputs that mimic sensory experience. To do this with confidence, we
  must connect our brain models to neuro-muscular models and provide
  relevant visual and proprioceptive feedback signals, thereby closing
  the loop of the simulation. This paper describes an effort to
  develop just such an integrated brain and biomechanical system using
  a number of pre-existing models. It describes a model of the
  saccadic oculomotor system incorporating a neuromuscular model of
  the eye and its six extraocular muscles. The position of the eye
  determines how illumination of a retinotopic input population
  projects information about the location of a saccade target into the
  system. A pre-existing saccadic burst generator model was
  incorporated into the system, which generated motoneuron activity
  patterns suitable for driving the biomechanical eye. The model was
  demonstrated to make accurate saccades to a target luminance under a
  set of environmental constraints. Challenges encountered in the
  development of this model showed the importance of this integrated
  modelling approach. Thus, we exposed shortcomings in individual
  model components which were only apparent when these were supplied
  with the more plausible inputs available in a closed loop
  design. Consequently we were able to suggest missing functionality
  which the system would require to reproduce more realistic
  behaviour. The construction of such closed-loop animal models
  constitutes a new paradigm of computational neurobehaviour and
  promises a more thoroughgoing approach to our understanding of the
  brain's function as a controller for movement and behaviour."
