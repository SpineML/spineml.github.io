# Spiking Neural Mark-up Language

Syntax for the three layers of SpineML model specification are governed by XML Schemas. These schemas ensure model syntax is well defined and perform key value matching to ensure references to document items exist. Both of which are important for automatic code generation using any of our supported Simulators.

Schemas can be downloaded from the SpineML Github Repository
