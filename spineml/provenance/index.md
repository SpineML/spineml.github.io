# Development history of SpineML

SpineML is an extension of a *Model Description Language* called [NineML](http://incf.github.io/nineml-spec/)
for the specification of neural network models. NineML (aka 9ML) is published by the [INCF](https://www.incf.org/).

Paul Richmond, Alex Cope, Dave Allerton and Kevin Gurney wished to implement a simulator toolchain
for models encoded in NineML. They found that some details were missing from the NineML
specification, preventing them from implementing their models. Taking a pragmatic approach, they made
necessary additions to the NineML spec to suit their needs. It is hoped that in the future, SpineML
will become an officially recognised extension to NineML.

You can read about SpineML in the following paper:
